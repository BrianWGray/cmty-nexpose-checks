  <Description>
    <p>An X server&#39;s access control is disabled (e.g. through an &quot;xhost +&quot; command) and allows anyone to connect to the server.</p>
    <p>The remote X11 server accepts connection from anywhere. An attacker may connect to it to eavesdrop on the keyboard and mouse events of a user on the remote host. It is even possible for an attacker to grab a screenshot of the remote host or to display arbitrary programs. 

An attacker may exploit this flaw to obtain the username and password of a user on the remote host. 

The X-Win32 client by default allows incoming X Windows sessions from any location.  Essentially this means that anyone on the internet
may remotely open an X Windows application on your local computer. This may be used in some cases as a keylogger which could then capture sensitive information such as passwords or credit card numbers that you are typing in.</p>
